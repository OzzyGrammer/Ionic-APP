# Ionic-APP
This was my first Ionic-Angular app and even though it appears to be a small scale app it was very interesting from my perspective. I spent 40% of the time setting up my environment with just ionic docs as my guide. Not forgetting to mention stack overflow for helping me figure out bugs experienced during development. I am using the Linux operating system and I had to go on askubuntu.com for terminal/system related challenges. Unfortunately I was unable Build an apk due to challenges beyond my knowledge and skill, the Android sdk and the Java Development Kit to be specific were the ones I had an issue with. The Android sdk for one gave me these errors : "Failed to find 'ANDROID_HOME' environment variable. Try setting it manually. Failed to find 'android' command in your 'PATH'. Try update your 'PATH' to include path to valid SDK directory" I tried every solution I could click my mouse on online and eventually it was solved/no more error on android. 
On the other hand the Java Development Kit gave me the errors : "Failed to run "javac -version", make sure that you have a JDK version 8 installed. You can get it from the following location: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" which I had to re install the JDK 8 again and configure the path and still didn't go away. I tried to look for a solution to this problem again online but I still couldn't resolve it.
